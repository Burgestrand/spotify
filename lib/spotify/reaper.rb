  # Garbage collection may happen in a separate thread, and if we are
  # unfortunate enough the main thread will hold the API lock around Spotify,
  # which makes it impossible for the GC thread to obtain the lock to release
  # pointers.
  #
  # When garbage collection happens in a separate thread, itâ€™s possible that
  # the main threads will not run until garbage collection is finished. If the
  # GC thread deadlocks, the entire application deadlocks.
  #
  # The idea is to locklessly pass pointers that need releasing to a queue. The
  # worker working the queue should be safe to acquire the API lock because
  # nobody is waiting for the working queue to ever finish.
